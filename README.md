# es-de-linux-custom-systems

Custom systems and find rules file for ES-DE primarily for Linux systems and and the Steam Deck. 

## How to Use

Download the `es_find_rules.xml` and `es_systems.xml` file and place the two files in `~/ES-DE/custom_systems`. On the Steam Deck, this will be `/home/deck/ES-DE/custom_systems`. 

If files exist already, you may open the two files downloaded from this repo and copy the contents to the pre-existing files. Ensure that you do not duplicate the header and closer lines. For `es_find_rules.xml`, the lines will be `<ruleList>` and `</ruleList>` respectively. For `es_systems.xml`, the lines will be `<systemList>` and `</systemList>` respectively. 

## Issues

This **is not** a support repository for these emulators. If an emulator is not working, report the issue to the emulator developers directly. If one of the downloaded files is misconfigured, you may open an issue or pull request on this repository. **Do not** link to the download page of the emulator in your GitHub issue.
